# Reminding myself of Basic Steps: A Summary of GitHub Guides
1. Create a new repository 
- Initialise with a README document (here it is!)
2. Create a branch
- Branch off Master to create a copy
3. Make a commit (saved change)
- Messages are key to show others what you've done & why
4. Make a pull request 
- You can open a pull request at any point during the development process, to ask someone to review your work or just to share an idea
- By using GitHub's @mention system, you can ask specific people/teams for feedback
- Open pull requests in your own repository & merge them yourself to practice GitHub Flow
- You can close certain issues in your pull request. E.g. close #10 would close issue no. 10 in repository (https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)
5. Merge pull request
